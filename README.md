# Notion Deadline Planner

You will need to add an `.env` file with your notion api key and detabase key. Afterward, add your integration api to the database. You may need to edit `addClassDeadlines.js` to change what properties are stored by the database.

Finally, you should edit the marked variables in `index.js` to schedule the desired events.

### Features:
* Confirmation before scheduling events.
* Customize whether some weeks of assignments are skipped.
